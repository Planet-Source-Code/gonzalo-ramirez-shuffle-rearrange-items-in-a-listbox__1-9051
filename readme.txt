' | You may use this code any way you'd like (except for launching  | |
' | nuclear missles, and such). If this code has been helpful to    | |
' | you, send me an e-mail and let me know. That's all I ask. Just  | |
' | because you found this code, do not go on without learning  to  | |
' | do it youself. For that reason I have included documentation of | |
' | ever line of code.                                              | |

' | P.S. This is my first submition to www.Planet-Source-Code.com,  | |
' |      so feedback would be nice :)                               | |
